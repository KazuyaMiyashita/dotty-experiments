# Circe and Cats for Dotty

[![Build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/travisbrown/dotty-experiments/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/travisbrown/dotty-experiments)

This is an experimental and opinionated port of [Circe][circe] and [Cats][cats] from Scala 2 to [Dotty][dotty],
a language and compiler that will become Scala 3.

## Motivation

The goal of this experiment isn't primarily to allow the use of Circe or Cats on Dotty:
the Dotty compiler provides compatibility with Scala 2 artifacts that makes this largely
unnecessary, and apart from some macro-supported functionality such as Circe's generic derivation
or Cats's `FunctionK` syntax, using Cats and Circe from Dotty is just a matter of sticking
`withDottyCompat` on your dependencies (see the `compat` directory for a configured example
project). Instead this project is intended to be a kind of sandbox for trying out new language
features in the context of these libraries.

## Changes

This project is an experiment and its shape and scope are subject to change. Right now there are a
few major differences between its implementation and the original Scala 2 libraries:

* Cats's standard library instances are not orphaned. One of the criticisms of Scala 2 that Dotty
  explicitly aims to address is "over-reliance on implicit imports". I've always hated the fact
  that Cats requires imports for standard library instances, and I've always suspected that the
  difficulty of unorphaning them was exaggerated, but making the change was even easier than I
  expected. I don't _think_ it relies on anything Dotty-specific, and I'll probably take a shot at
  backporting it to Scala 2 as a proposal for Cats 3 (although I'm not holding my breath).
* I've changed `NonEmptyChain` to use an opaque type-based representation.
* Type class derivation is supported via `derives` for a few type classes, including `Eq`,
  `Monoid`, `Encoder`, and `Decoder`.
* I've implemented a simplified version of the circe-literal `json` string interpolator using
  Dotty macros (interpolating variables into key positions isn't supported, for example).
* The top-level `cats` package has been moved into the `io.circe` namespace (I did this because I
  originally thought I might want to try things out side-by-side with the official Scala 2 Cats
  packages).
* The tests that have been moved into the Dotty ports (which isn't most of them) have also been
  migrated from ScalaTest to [Minitest][minitest]. While it may be possible to use ScalaTest
  from Dotty, the pervasive use of macros makes it uncomfortable, and I was running into enough
  problems that I just decided to switch, and have had essentially zero issues with the Scala 2
  Minitest artifacts. For what it's worth I'm considering backporting the Minitest migration of
  the Circe tests from here to Circe proper.

## Future

I'm likely to keep playing with this, and will probably publish artifacts at some point.

## Prior art

Michael Pilquist's [Spotted Leopards](https://github.com/typelevel/spotted-leopards) project is a
similar experiment that takes a very different approach, pushing extension methods to the foreground
by making them the basis of Cats's type class interfaces. Here's an example of what this approach
might look like:

```scala
scala> trait Functor[F[_]] {
     |   def (fa: F[A]) fmap[A, B](f: A => B): F[B]
     | }
     |
     | object Functor {
     |   given as Functor[Option] {
     |     def (fa: Option[A]) fmap[A, B](f: A => B): Option[B] = fa.map(f)
     |   }  
     | }
// defined trait Functor
// defined object Functor

scala> the[Functor[Option]].fmap(Option(0))(_ + 1)
val res0: Option[Int] = Some(1)

scala> import given Functor._

scala> Option(0).fmap(_ + 1)
val res1: Option[Int] = Some(1)
```

This is a modification of the approach in Spotted Leopards in that I've put the `Functor[Option]`
instance into implicit scope, while in Spotted Leopards instances must be imported, which means
that the instances and their syntax come togetherâ€”it's not possible (I think?) to put the instances
into scope without also getting their syntax. This makes me really uncomfortable; your mileage may
vary.

There are things I like about the modified version of this approach above (e.g. much less
repetition, since the syntax constitutes the type class operations directly). It seems odd to me to
import instances that are already in implicit scope to get syntax, though, and supporting a kitchen-sink
`syntax` import could be tricky.
